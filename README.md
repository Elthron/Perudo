# Perudo

Perudo webserver project with aspirations of creating competent machine intelligences so that we can finally destroy other Joe and Rob at perudo.

We will also be releasing a gaming console designed exclusively to run the perudo client in order to satiate the inevitible flood of demand for this game in people's homes.

#Server To Do:
- add player reward mechanisms
- write an actually competant AI [Anyone] -> on-going


#Client To Do:
- make gui
- test client with the real perudo server to check our work works together properly (fingercrossed)

######(also bugfix but that goes without saying :P )
