# Perudo

Perudo webserver project with aspirations of creating competent machine intelligences so that we can finally destroy Joe and Rob at perudo.

#To Do:

-finalise comunication between client and server [Joe]\n
  -actually write a more purpose built client program [Joe]\n
-add an exit button for the server ( more threading? >:) ) [Ben]\n
-throttle the various thread loops so that they don't overheat whatever they happen to be running on [Ben]\n
-write an actually competant AI [anyone]\n
\n
(also bugfix but that goes without saying :P )
