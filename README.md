# Perudo

Perudo webserver project with aspirations of creating competent machine intelligences so that we can finally destroy other Joe and Rob at perudo.

We will also be releasing a gaming console designed exclusively to run the perudo client in order to satiate the inevitible flood of demand for this game in people's homes.

#To Do:

- finalise comunication between client and server [Joe]
  - write a more purpose built client program [Joe(mostly)]
- throttle the various thread loops [Anyone] -> done to a basic degree
- write an actually competant AI [Anyone] -> on-going

######(also bugfix but that goes without saying :P )
