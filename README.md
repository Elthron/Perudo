# Perudo

Perudo webserver project with aspirations of creating competent machine intelligences so that we can finally destroy Joe and Rob at perudo.

\#notbitter

#To Do:

-finalise comunication between client and server [Joe]
  -actually write a more purpose built client program [Joe]
-add an exit button for the server ( more threading? >:) ) [Ben]
-throttle the various thread loops so that they don't overheat whatever they happen to be running on [Ben]
-write an actually competant AI [anyone]

(also bugfix but that goes without saying :P )
