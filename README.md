#To Do:

- finalise comunication between client and server [Joe]
  - write a more purpose built client program [Joe(mostly)]
- fix a logic error I just found in ThreadSafeList
- throttle the various thread loops [Anyone] -> done to a basic degree
- write an actually competant AI [Anyone] -> on-going
