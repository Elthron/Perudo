# Perudo

Perudo webserver project with aspirations of creating competent machine intelligences so that we can finally destroy other Joe and Rob at perudo.

We will also be releasing a gaming console designed exclusively to run the perudo client in order to satiate the inevitible flood of demand for this game in people's homes.

#Server To Do:
- add player reward mechanisms
- work out why the server randomly turns off
- work out where all the output messages are coming from and why they are in the wrong order
- write an actually competant AI [Anyone] -> on-going


#Client To Do:
- work out why the message chopped the "Fr" off of "Frodo"
- make gui
- test client with the real perudo server to check our work works together properly (fingercrossed)
