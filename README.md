# Perudo

Perudo webserver project with aspirations of creating competent machine intelligences so that we can finally destroy other Joe and Rob at perudo.

We will also be releasing a gaming console designed exclusively to run the perudo client in order to satiate the inevitible flood of demand for this game in people's homes.

#Server To Do:

- broadcast the player list on game start
- broadcast the loss of dice
- write an actually competant AI [Anyone] -> on-going


#Client To Do:
- Write client manager function
- Write Serialisation
- make data objects
- do prepend stuff
- make gui

######(also bugfix but that goes without saying :P )
